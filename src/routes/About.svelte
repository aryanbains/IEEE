Our esteemed IEEE student branch was established in 2008 and has been flourishing ever since.<br><br>
            IEEE GTBIT SB has been enhancing the technical skills of the student members, helping them on the way with a very holistic growth plan. We have 3 chapters functioning in our college, namely the main IEEE student branch, IEEE WIE, and IEEE CS, all of which are closely-knit and make our society form a strong peer-network bond, this has greatly helped us in improving the communication skills of our students.
            In addition, we are the sole professional society in the college which makes joining IEEE an experience of its own. Conducting various conferences, events, workshops, making event reports, creating IEEE research papers, SIGs for different fields, International competitions, and many more activities have enabled us to produce capable and successful students since our inception, thus making us good at what we do.</p>
